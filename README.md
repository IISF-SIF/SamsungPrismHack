# Samsung AI Hackathon Submission

Welcome to our submission for the Samsung AI Hackathon! Below you'll find details about our project, the inspiration behind it, and the components we've developed to address the challenges faced by users in the Indian market.

## Mission: AI Conversational Assistant for India üåê

The inspiration behind our project stems from a deep understanding and appreciation of the linguistic and cultural diversity that characterizes India. With approximately 22 Indic languages spoken across the nation, we recognized the need for an AI-based Conversational Assistant tailored specifically to cater to this diverse linguistic landscape.

### Journey Inception üõ§

Our journey began with the realization that a large portion of India's population communicates using languages that are often overlooked by mainstream technology solutions. This realization ignited a passion within us to bridge this gap and create a transformative solution that not only understands but celebrates India's linguistic diversity.

By developing an AI Assistant capable of seamless communication in multiple languages, maintaining context, and authenticity, we aim to set new standards in inclusivity. Leveraging state-of-the-art language models such as Mistral Instruct 7b v0.2 and llava-1.5-7b-hf, our solution not only meets current needs but also positions us favorably for future implications of multimodal interactions.
